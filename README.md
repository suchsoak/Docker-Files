>  [!Note]
> This project was inspired by a github from jessfraz, she inspired me to make these scripts. So I also recommend you take a look at the amazing work she did: https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles

# Scripts

We have here scrips to get hacker tools like nmap, aircrack-ng. Also to get programming languages and many other scrips. Enjoy and have fun.

So I'll also put in more scrips over time.

If you want to take the docker images use this command: `docker system prune -a`

# Usage

```sh
  docker build -f <Dockerfile> -t <name> .
```

>[!TIP]
>To make the scripts easier to use, you can use the Makefile. Just place the make command inside the folder in the terminal where the Makefile file is located.

```sh
  make
```
