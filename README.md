# Docker-Files

Dockerfiles for let our lifes more eay

>  [!Note]
> This project was inspired by a github from jessfraz, she inspired me to make these scripts. So I also recommend you take a look at the amazing work she did: https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles

# Scripts

We have here scrips to get hacker tools like nmap, aircrack-ng. Also to get programming languages and many other scrips. Enjoy and have fun.

To improve the understanding I will put as an update, something like: v1.0.0 and so on. So I'll also put in more scrips over time.

# Usage

```sh
  docker build -f <Dockerfile> -t <name> .
```

>[!TIP]
>To make the scripts easier to use, you can use the Makefile. Just place the make command inside the folder in the terminal where the Makefile file is located.

```sh
  make
```
